    "# Graph Representation Interconversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be represented in multiple ways, such as using dictionaries, tuples, or matrices. Each representation has its own advantages depending on the operation you need to perform. Below, we will explore how to interconvert between these different representations of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graph Representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Dictionary Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node is a key, and its neighbors (adjacent nodes) are stored in a list as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\"s1\": [\"s2\", \"s5\"], \"s2\": [\"s1\", \"s3\"], \"s3\": [\"s2\", \"s4\"], \"s4\": [\"s3\"], \"s5\": [\"s1\"]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### 2. Tuple Representation:\n",
    "Each edge is represented as a tuple (node1, node2). For undirected graphs, each connection is stored twice, once for each direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[(\"s1\", \"s2\"), (\"s1\", \"s5\"), (\"s2\", \"s1\"), (\"s2\", \"s3\"), (\"s2\", \"s5\"), (\"s3\", \"s2\"), (\"s3\", \"s4\"), (\"s4\", \"s3\"), (\"s5\", \"s1\")]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Matrix Representation:\n",
    "The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where a 1 indicates a connection between nodes, and 0 indicates no connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    " [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n",
    " [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n",
    " [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n",
